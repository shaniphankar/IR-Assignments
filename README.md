# Description
<ul><li>The objective of the search engine is to find the restaurants which best match the query given by the user based on previous user reviews. Here we made use of the Yelp Academic Dataset as the corpus. Currently, we make use of TF_IDF ( Term frequency, Inverse Document Frequency ).</li>
<li>In the near future, we plan to get results using BM25 and then we wish to combine the best of  the two algorithms to give a overall better result by clustering the similar results.</li>
